# What is a synth?
* Digital or Analog
* Multiple Paradigms
  * Subtractive
  * Additive
  * Frequency Modulation
  * Granular

---

# What is a subtractive synth?
* Takes a signal from an Oscillator
* Passes it through a series of components that subtract from the signal

---

# Signals
* Continuous streams of values
* Digitally represented as an array of N bit values
* Electronic trickery makes these work
* Composed of many Sine waves at various phases and velocities at any one point

---

# Pitched signals
* Follow a harmonic structure
* has a sine wave at the 'fundamental' frequency
* contains sine waves at various multiples of the fundamental frequency

# Oscillators
* Generate the waveforms

# DEMO

---

# Filters
They 'filter' part of the harmonic content out of the sound.
* Various types
  * Low Pass
  * High Pass
  * Band Pass
  * Band Reject

---

# DEMO

---

# Envelope generator
Controls the volume of the sound over time.
